# ----------- Evaluation -----------

The result is that CSMA/CD ALOHA performs best, especially with a P value of 0.15.

The results can be explained as follows:
CSMA/CD is typically better than CSMA, because transmissions can be cancelled earlier.
This means that less time is wasted transmitting remainders of packets that will any ways not be used.
The P value for ALOHA should be low for CSMA, as this ensure that there are less collisions.
The same holds for CSMA/CD.
For BEB, it is also true that CSMA/CD performs better than CSMA, due to the reasons mentioned above.

The result is that ALOHA can perform better than BEB, when choosing an appropriate value for P.
To judge whether there is a reason to prefer BEB over ALOHA in practice, we consider the assumptions ALOHA has:

* The probability value has to be chosen in prior and significantly influences the results.
* The backoff time is the transmission time of one packet or multiples of one packet transmission time.

First, in BEB there is no need to chose a probability value, optimize it for the given scenario and synchronize it between participants.
Second, BEB uses flexible retransmission times that evolve exponentially. This makes no assumptions about the transmission time of one packet.
Consequently, participants can sent packets of different sizes and if there are frequent collisions with a longer packet, all participants will backoff far enough to allow the collision-free transmission of this packet. 
In ALOHA, this could also be achieved eventually, but would take longer, as the nodes do not consider the number of collisions.

Furthermore, having different numbers nodes that are differently spaced could require to tweak the P value, as the likelihood of collisions decreases or increases.
BEB might not find the optimal solution for this, but nevertheless it can adapt to these settings by choosing backoff times that are dependent on the number of collisions.
Taking all this into account one could see BEB that is more dynamic as ALOHA, as it can easier react to high network congestions, respectively single occasional conflicts.
