# ----------- CSMA ALOHA -----------

For CSMA Alohoa, we differentiated between wether decided that the two cases where the node may actually do something are
    a) when there is something to send and the channel is idle and we are not in sending state ourself 
and 
    b) when the node is sending and 1 time unit has passed, such that we need to stop sending.
    In b) we then check after finishing the whole transmission wether a collision occured with (maxSignals[i] > 1)
Case a) is split up in two cases:
    1) We need to do a retransmit
    2) We do not do a retransmit
Case 1) uses a probabilistic case distinction as noted in the project description such that only with probability P a retransmission is done

# ----------- CSMA/CD ALOHA -----------

The sending part (part a)) of CSMA/CD Aloha is the same as the one for CMSA Aloha, as this part handles sending and 
retransmissions which obviously must be the same (both use Aloha).
Part b) is different from CSMA in the way that we modified the condition to stop sending.
Instead of checking wether a collision occured, after finishing the transmission, we can check it while sending.
We need to add that the timer is > 0.5 due to the specification from the project description. 
But as soon as t >= 0.5, we allow to stop sending as soon as a collision is sensed.

# ----------- CSMA BEB -----------

The transmission part (part b) of CSMA BEB is similar to the one of CSMA Aloha.
Only due to the fact that we do BEB here, we need to add two additional variable assignments.
Otherwise behavior is the same as for part b) of CMSA Aloha.
The first assignment is that when a collision occured, we need to multiply our maximum waiting time by 2 to get the next power of 2, as described in the algorithm for BEB.
The second one is randomly choosing uniformly distributed a waitingTime in the range between the "old" maximum backoff time and 0.

The sending part (part a) ) is not split up as for Aloha. 
Instead we ensure that we are not doing a retransmit or that we have waited sufficient time (using the clock) in the guarding
when statement. 
All other parts of the condition stay the same.
For consistency, we should not be sending, there should be noone else sending and we must have packets to send.


# ----------- CSMA/CD ALOHA -----------

This model is a combination of the code of CSMA BEB anf CSMA/CD Aloha.

We add as for CSMA BEB, the two assignments of the maximum backoff time and the random waiting time.
Furthermore, we modify the conditions guarding the sending as for CSMA BEB 

 As for CSMA/CD Aloha, we have a condition guarding the stopping of the transmission that is able to stop sending as soon as we sense a collision and 0.5 time units waiting time have passed.
