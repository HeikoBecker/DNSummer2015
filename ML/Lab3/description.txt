For all models we could use the same skeleton, where we differentiate inside a do loop, wether we are sending and need to stop
or wether we are not sending and can start a transmission.
The transmission initialization code is always the same.
We need to ensure that we are not sending currently, there are no other nodes sending and there are packets to send.
Furthermore we either should not be in the need of doing a retransmit or if we need to, sufficient time must have 
passed such that we have waited long enough.
The only difference for each model lies in the generation of the backoff times (last 1 or two lines of the second when block)
and the condition for collision detection (when guard of the second when statement)
For each protocol we detail why we chose which condition and backoff time computation.

# ----------- CSMA ALOHA -----------

The backoff time for ALOHA is the Geometric Distribution of the model parameter P, as this gives us the number
of time units we would have waited based on the probability P, as hinted in the project description.

The CSMA collision detection can only happen after finishing the transmission, hence we require, that a full time
unit has passed and then check wether a collision occured.(maxSignals[i] > 1)

# ----------- CSMA/CD ALOHA -----------

We use again as before the Geometric Distribution.

The CSMA/CD collision detection can happen as soon as there is a collision sensed, during the transmission.
Therefore we ensure that t >= 0.5, due to the delay specifications from the sheet, but allow afterwards,
as soon as a collision is sensed to abort transmission, as described in the algorithm for CSMA/CD.

# ----------- CSMA BEB -----------

The backoff time computation for BEB consists of two assignments.
The first assignment is that when a collision occured, we need to multiply our maximum waiting time by 2 to get the next power of 2, as described in the algorithm for BEB.
The second one is randomly choosing uniformly distributed a waitingTime in the range between the "old" maximum backoff time and 0.

We do again CSMA collision detection as for CSMA ALOHA.

# ----------- CSMA/CD BEB -----------

As for CSMA BEB we do the same backoff computation.

As for CSMA/CD ALOHA, we use the same guard for retransmission.
